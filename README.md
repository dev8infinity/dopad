## TODO

## General

- Put projects in separate folders and github actions X
- Create project description
- Create project how to deploy

### Frontend
- image container with copy button X
- file container with download button X
- paste file X

- copy button style of the entire page
- can upload a bunch of images and files at the same time X
- let the user delete everything X, but also, update the state X

- let the user select text from different divs X
- 'X' button to remove the image and unify the Content X


- Create upload
- Create the socket
- Create snapshot option, so you can go back in time to that snapshot

Extra:
- cntrl + z and cntrl + y mechanics

### Backend

- Create the socket
- Create DB
- Create API
- Create upload

### App

- See if app can have the copy button
- See how you can make it open/close the window with shortcut 


## Bugs

- when writing the cursor is going to the left, possible because the state is updating X
- Delete and cut is erasing the entire div, not just the selected text X

## Improvements

- when a text is focused I can paste image in the position choosen, to do this: you need to create a function to separate the inital Content into two and put the image content in between
